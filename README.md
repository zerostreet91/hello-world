# hello-world
First-step and another repository
Hello! I've been planning to break into the tech world for so long.
I've just started, learning to code and still at the start with HTML and CSS.
I still have a 9to5 job, but planning to quit within 12month once my tech career takes off.
learning to code is the best foriegn language you can learn.
And I have not felt this excited or in a creative state of mind for years.
I really look forward to getting a chance to work on a project with some of the great minds here.
Wish me luck and see you all on the other side.
Thank you!
